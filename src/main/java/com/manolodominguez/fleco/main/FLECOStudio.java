 * CyberTOMP® is a cybersecurity framework that helps organizations manage and 
 * assess security at a tactical and operational level by focusing on business 
 * assets. It provides structured processes, metrics, and roles to align people,
 * technology, and supply chains, enabling informed decision-making based on 
 * asset criticality. Compatible with standards like ISO 27001 and NIST, it also
 * incorporates practical tools and optimization techniques to deliver a 
 * cohesive, measurable, and efficient approach to cybersecurity.
 * 
 * Within CyberTOMP®, FLECO (Fast, Lightweight, and Efficient Cybersecurity 
 * Optimization) is an adaptive, constrained genetic algorithm designed to 
 * support asset cybersecurity teams in decision-making throughout the 
 * application of the CyberTOMP® framework. The cybertomp-fleco-studio tool
 * provides a visual way of usion/applying CyberTOMP® FLECO algorithm through a 
 * standalone Swing application.
 *
 * Visit https://cybertomp.org to learn more about the CyberTOMP® framework, 
 * the collaborative project behind it, its components, and its research 
 * foundations, all of which continuously evolve based on empirical evidence and
 * solid, verifiable principles.
